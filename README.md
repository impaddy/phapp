usage
====
Once you have downloaded phapp place the document root within your server(Apache2, NGNIX)
you will see 2 folders, App & Core, you only need to modify stuff that is inside the 'APP' folder
this is where the content is loaded through and the only files that need to be modified are in there
if you decide to modify any other files bare in mind this could cause security issues or deployment issues.

this software is free... if you find any issues send them via GitHub, if you have any other questions regarding Phapp
